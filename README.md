# RangeBuddy

Personal Android class project. An app that calculates windage and elevation corrections for AR match shooting or military style rifle qualification, allows the user to plot impacts on a virtual target and save each engagement for future referance.

Need to add logic for calculating wind corrections, text view to display them and the ability to display saved engagements. I also need to figure out how to kill the portrait layout so that the app operates only in the landscape profile.
