# RangeBuddy

Personal Android class project. An app that calculates windage and elevation corrections for AR match shooting or military style rifle qualification. It also allows the user to plot target impacts on a virtual target of various styles and save each engagement for future referance.

Need to add logic for calculating wind corrections, text view to display them and the ability to display saved engagements. I also need to figure out how to kill the portrait layout so that the app operates only in the landscape profile.
